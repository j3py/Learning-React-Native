# WeatherProject Groundhog Day US-only Edition

### Basic project idea seeded from the excellent ["Learning React Native"](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041511.do "Learning React Native at O'Reilly") by [Bonnie Eisenman](https://github.com/bonniee/learning-react-native "Bonnie Eisenman on GitHub").

### Animated bar graph idea seeded from [wwayne's excellent example.](https://github.com/wwayne/react-native-nba-app "wwayne's excellent animated bar graphs on GitHub")  

### Currently fetches weather data for US locations only.

### TO-DO:

- add redux
- add react-native-chart or otherwise make charts more useful
- update charts for weekly views (consider other timeframes)
- add flip card animation for easy navigation between detail views
- add tests for props and get enzyme's mount method working with jsdom
